        In the alternate reality known as the Age of Apocalypse, Richards never
        received superpowers as he was never bombarded with cosmic radiation in
        space. Instead he attempted to evacuate a large group of humans from
        Manhattan during Apocalypse's regime. Along with Ben Grimm as the pilot
        and his friends Johnny and Susan Storm as crew, Richards used one of his
        prototype rockets to fly off the island. Unfortunately, a mutant
        sabotaged the launch and both Reed and Johnny sacrificed themselves to
        let the others blast off safely.
